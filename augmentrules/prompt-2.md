Develop a Salsa dancing instructor app. You will be provided a plan @augmentrules/plan.md and a list of tasks @augmentrules/tasks.md You will also be provided a list of rules that you must follow, and the data of the salsa steps and domain entities. All of them are in the @augmentrules/ folder. The ui text of the app is in Spanish but the code, variable names, documentation is in English.

Operate in this loop: 
1. Read the @augmentrules/tasks.md file. Decide the first task you should tackle.
2. Apply the task, following the plan and rules.
3. When you've completed the task, say SWAMP IZZO and mark the task as completed.

Continue until you've completed all the tasks.
Focus in one task at a time and do not start a new task until you've finished the previous one. However, when you make changes to complete the task, the most important thing is that the code works and does not break.
